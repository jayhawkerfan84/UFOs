# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of the webpage is to allow users to look up UFO sightings using multiple criteria. The criteria are the following

date, city, state, country, shape. At least one of the criteria needs to be entered to return results. 

The purpose is well defined (2 pt)
Results:

There is a description of how to perform a search, with images. (4 pt)
Summary: To perform a search a user just needs to enter at least on of the search criteria. After clicking on the 

find results button the user should see the results return match all of the criteria entered.

## The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage (2 pt)
Free form fields which can lead to data entry errors, confusing users expecting to see certain results. 

## The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development (4 pt)
I would add a date calendar to the date selection field. This would make it easier to enter in a date. 

I would also have drop down fields where it makes sense. For example, I think the shape field could be a drop down so 

users would not have to guess the shape. It would be dynamic to include need shapes that were added to the data set.
